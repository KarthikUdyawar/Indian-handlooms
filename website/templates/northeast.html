            <p>The textile patterns found among the tribes of Arunachal Pradesh such as Adi, Mishmi and Apatani are invariably of geometric pattern. Most popular motives are Zig-Zag lines and angular designs. The floral and Zemorphic patterns are more or
                less geometric form. The simple and straight lines, stripes and Aa bands and similar other patterns are most common. Contrasts and combination of colours are quite popular. The highly disciplined Adi and Apatani concentrate on simple straight
                line, while the strongly individualistic Mishmis go in for great celebration of pattern.The Adi have a great variety of straight forward patterns. There are arrangements of red and black strips on white ground, white and yellow strips
                on a black ground alternate bands of red and black ground, white bands of red and black or of olive green and brown, broad border-bands of brown with a central narrow strips of black and white and the body of the cloth being black with
                brown black and white strips at a three-inch interval.</p>

            <p>Churia or Dhuti It was an unstitched main male dress in medieval age. It was 8 to 16 cubits long and from 2 to 2.25 cubits wide. It was plain and free from any decoration. A few ethnic groups were woven endi-dhuti for cold season. The cloth
                was worn round the waist and hanging down to the knee or below it. At the beginning, this „churia’ or „dhuti’ was held tight round the waist with a sort of girdle called „parivesa’, which was also known as „Komarbandh’ (like modern belt).
                In this period, the higher officials, the head of the satras and Brahmin used silk and muga churia, which extended below the knee. In religious function or to worship of God, red coloured silk dhuties were mostly preferred by priest. According
                to the Guru-charit, the „churia’ was called as „Bhuni’</p>

            <h2>MEGHALAYA</h2>
            <img src="https://textilevaluechain.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18165156/n-1-364x300.jpg"><br><br>
            <p>Meghalaya is the homeland of three ancient hill communities, the Khasi, Jaintias and Garos, and is a land of considerable natural beauty. The important crafts are cane and bamboo works, artistic weaving and woodcarving. Weaving is the traditional
                occupation of Garo women and is currently pursued by almost every family. The production of cotton textile items is restricted by and large restricted to dakmanda, worn from the waist to a little below the knee. The Garos also weave shirting,
                bedcovers, bed sheets, and tablecloths. The endi silk produced in Meghalaya is famous for its texture and durability. The important center for weaving endi silk is Sonidan, a village of about hundred bamboo huts. Besides Sonidan, women
                in some other villages carry out endi silk weaving. Moreover, the production of jainsen (typical Meghalaya women’s wear) with local mulberry silk has also been introduced. Silk weaving has generally encouraged through training of local
                weavers in a number of places, production on commercial lines. Women do weaving in their spare time and use back-strap or loin-looms, the only exception being the garos who also use frame-looms. Endi silk-weaving, famous for its feel and
                sturdiness, is carried out by the local women.</p>

            <h2>MANIPUR</h2>
            <img src="https://textilevaluechain.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18171050/1520498021_Manipur-dance1.jpg"><br><br>
            <p>Manipur is famous for its special fabrics like moiraingphee, leirum, lasingphee and phanek. Tribal textiles are woven on a loin-loom, a type of back-strap loom commonly used by hill people. The warp of manageable length and breadth is prepared
                and fastened at one end generally to the wall of a house or to two fixed poles while the other is tied to the waist of the weaver with a cotton or leather belt. Sometimes the belt is woven out of cane or bamboo. Weaving is universal and
                every girl knows how to weave. The loom forms part of her dowry. Weaving is done purely for personal use, by the women, while highly organized commercial weaving is done by men. There is an aura of religion and romance around cotton-weaving.
                Each process and design is highlighted by a legend and connected with special functions, dances, and ceremonies. Ningthou phee and akoibi are based on snake motifs and the design is worn by royalty. These designs are mostly found on the
                phaneks. Tradition has it that when a weaver used to sit down to weave the ningthou phee, the royal design, a gun salute would be fired in honor. A black shawl with thick, bold embroidered animal motifs is called the angami naga (sami
                lami phee). It was given to brave and distinguished warriors by the royalty, in recognition of their prowess and ability. Phaneks are woman’s lungies and the morang phee is the traditional Manipuri sari with a temple border. Likli or bottle
                designs resembling a loom-accessory and lasing phee (a quilted design to keep warm in winter as Manipur has no wool) are popular. Shamilami is a combination of weaving and embroidery once considered a status symbol.</p>
